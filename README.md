This is Will's first git project!
testing fork and clone the repo to my own working directory
do a branch and edited the README file and commit and then push the branch to origin. 

NOT TOO SURE What is wrong but somehow my fork is 1 commit ahead? weird.

Also the branch "test" that I have deleted is still showing in github...


2nd test:
fork, clone then edit on master file without using branch and then commit to the repo and see will it got merged.
